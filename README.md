## The Odin Project: Fundamentals - Rock Paper Scissors 

This project first involved creating a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in console.log with prompt being used to take the users input. It was then expanded upon in the browser by creating a basic HTML layout, and some CSS to make it look visually appealing. The JavaScript was then fleshed out using DOM and extra features were added including images changing to reflect selection, comments appearing based on the results of each round, and first to 5 points implemented - adding a Play Again button once a winner was declared.

### Original Project:

1. Create a game of rock paper scissors to be played against the computer
2. Using console.log, display the choices of both player and computer and the results of 5 rounds 
3. Display whether the player won, lost or drew after 5 rounds

### Updated Project, steps taken:

1. Create CSS and JavaScript folders and file structure to start building a UI so that the game can be played from the browser and not just the console.log
2. Upload images assets for rock, paper and scissors
3. Create HTML layout with CSS styles including hover over players choice
4. Create image change on selection and move gameplay to the DOM
5. Reload button to appear once 5 points is reached by either side with no input being counted once 5 points is reached
6. General clean up of JavaScript with comments added
