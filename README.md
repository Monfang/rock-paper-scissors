## The Odin Project: Fundamentals: Rock Paper Scissors 

### Original Project:

1. Create a game of rock paper scissors to be played against the computer
2. Using console.log, display the choices of both player and computer and the results of 5 rounds 
3. Display whether the player won, lost or drew after 5 rounds

### Updated Project:

1. Create a UI so that the game can be played from the browser and not just console.log
2. Made the game first to 5 wins, with a button displaying "Play Again!" that reloads the page
